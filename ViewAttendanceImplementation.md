## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure (from Attendance.js model)

```javascript
{
  classId: ObjectId,
  teacherId: ObjectId,
  batchId: ObjectId,
  sessionDate: Date,
  sessionTime: String,
  attendanceRecords: [{
    studentId: ObjectId,
    status: "present" | "absent" | "late" | "excused",
    notes: String,
    markedAt: Date
  }],
  totalStudents: Number,
  presentCount: Number,
  absentCount: Number,
  lateCount: Number,
  excusedCount: Number,
  status: "draft" | "final"
}
```

### API Endpoints to Use

- `attendanceService.getClassAttendance(classId)` - Get all attendance records
- `attendanceService.getAttendanceStats(classId)` - Get statistics
- `attendanceService.checkAttendanceExists(classId, date)` - Check if attendance exists

### Component Structure

```
ViewAttendance.jsx
├── No Attendance State
│   └── Start Marking Button (teal)
└── Has Attendance State
    ├── Tab Navigation (copied from ViewClass.jsx)
    ├── Overall Attendance Tab
    │   ├── Statistics Cards
    │   ├── Trends Chart
    │   └── Recent Records Table
    └── Individual Attendance Tab
        └── StudentIndividualAttendanceCard.jsx
            ├── Student List View
            └── Individual Student Detail View
                ├── Attendance Table
                ├── Date Range Filter
                └── Sorting Options
```
