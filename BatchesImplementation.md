Wait before that, I will tell you how the user flow will look like.

- In Batches tab:

when clicked on any batch in the table it will go to another page ( I mean instead of the table and search bar, it will show the #BatchesSettings.jsx component in which all the related setting are there which I told you which tell the number of students, we can enable, disable or reset the signup code and see the student who used the signup code and when)

There will be a breadcrumb after going in the batch settings which will look like this "Batch > {name of the batch}"

- In the Signup Codes tab

the signup codes will be visible in tabular format and will have list, card and an accordian view (where the it's sorted by it's active status) and when clicked on any sign up code it will go #SignUpCodesSettings.jsx in which we can enable, disable or reset the code and below it there will be the list of students who sign up using the code and when they signup.

The signup code will be hidden in a field and will have eye button to view a copy button a toggle to enable disable and a reset icon to reset the code.

Prefer the Chakra UI elements and luicide icons and don't make anything unnecessary.
